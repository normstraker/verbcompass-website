# Next Session Handoff — Educator Outreach Verification

**Last Updated:** September 3, 2026

The website work required for Founding Tester recruitment and feedback is live
and verified. General Reddit recruitment has not produced the needed tester
cohort. The educator-facing bridge is implemented locally on
`feature/educator-outreach` and awaits push, deploy-preview verification, and a
small private educator review.

The canonical reasons, goals, transparency requirements, audiences, assets,
outreach sequence, privacy rules, measurements, and checklist are in the
Android repository at:

`spanish-verb-companion/docs/EDUCATOR_OUTREACH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Live Paths

- Web edition: `https://app.verbcompass.com/`
- Founding Tester information and request:
  `https://www.verbcompass.com/founding-testers/`
- Founding Tester feedback:
  `https://www.verbcompass.com/founding-testers/feedback/`
- Educator resource after deployment:
  `https://www.verbcompass.com/educators/`

## Verified Workflow

The Android-only Information link opens the hosted feedback form. A completed
form is stored by Netlify, redirects to the dedicated thank-you page, and sends
a form-specific email notification to `support@verbcompass.com`.

## Next Steps

1. Push `feature/educator-outreach` and inspect its Netlify deploy preview.
2. Confirm Netlify detects the `educator-feedback` form, configure its
   notification to `support@verbcompass.com`, and submit an end-to-end test.
3. Verify the production-like layout on desktop and mobile, including the
   educator page, thank-you page, navigation, and Founding Tester role options.
4. Do not begin broad outreach until the educator materials receive a small
   private review.

The transparency message must make clear that the browser edition is genuinely
free with no testing obligation; the Android test supports the public Google
Play release; and that release establishes the foundation for future
VerbCompass English-verb editions, beginning with English for Spanish-speaking
learners.

Keep prospect details, tester emails, and submitted feedback private. Use the
Android repository's `docs/CLOSED_TEST_FEEDBACK_WORKFLOW.md` and
`docs/EDUCATOR_OUTREACH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` as the canonical operating
instructions.
